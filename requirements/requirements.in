# According to ruamel.yaml's PyPI page, we are suppose to use
# "<=0.15" in production until 0.15 becomes API stable.
# However we need ruamel.yaml 0.15.41 or greater for Python 3.7.
# We know that ruamel.yaml 0.15.52 breaks API in a way that
# is incompatible with BuildStream.

# See issues #571 and #790.
