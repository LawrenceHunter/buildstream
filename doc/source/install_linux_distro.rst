Installing BuildStream on a Linux distro
========================================
BuildStream requires the following base system requirements:

* python3 >= 3.5
* bubblewrap >= 0.1.2
* fuse2

BuildStream also depends on the host tools for the :mod:`Source <buildstream.source>` plugins.
Refer to the respective :ref:`source plugin <plugins_sources>` documentation for host tool
requirements of specific plugins.

The default plugins with extra host dependencies are:

* bzr
* deb
* git
* ostree
* patch
* tar

If you intend to push built artifacts to a remote artifact server,
which requires special permissions, you will also need:

* ssh


Installing from source (recommended)
------------------------------------
Until BuildStream is available in your distro, you will need to install
it yourself from the `git repository <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream.git>`_
using python's ``pip`` package manager. 

BuildStream follows the semantic versioning convention `(SemVer) <https://semver.org>`_ 
of releases and development snapshots. So where the version number is X.Y.Z 
and the Y is an even number, you have a release, but where Y is an odd number, 
you have a development snapshot. For example, 1.0 was the first ever release, 
then 1.1 was the development branch that came after it, etc. Therefore, when 
downloading from git, please look for the latest tag in the latest branch that 
has an even number for Y.

For the purpose of installing BuildStream while there are no distro packages,
you will additionally need:

* pip for python3 (only required for setup)
* Python 3 development libraries and headers
* git (to checkout buildstream)


Installing dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Arch Linux
++++++++++
Install the dependencies with::

  sudo pacman -S \
      python fuse2 bubblewrap \
      python-pip git

For the default plugins::

  sudo pacman -S \
      bzr git lzip ostree patch python-gobject


The package *python-arpy* is required by the deb source plugin. This is not
obtainable via `pacman`, you must get *python-arpy* from AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-arpy/

To install::

  wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/python-arpy.tar.gz
  tar -xvf python-arpy.tar.gz
  cd python-arpy
  makepkg -si

Debian
++++++
Install the dependencies with::

  sudo apt-get install \
      python3 fuse bubblewrap \
      python3-pip python3-dev git

For the default plugins:

Stretch
^^^^^^^
With stretch, you first need to ensure that you have the backports repository
setup as described `here <https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/>`_

By adding the following line to your sources.list::

  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main

And then running::

  sudo apt update

At this point you should be able to get the system requirements for the default plugins with::

  sudo apt install \
      bzr git lzip patch python3-arpy python3-gi
  sudo apt install -t stretch-backports \
      gir1.2-ostree-1.0 ostree

Buster or Sid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For debian unstable or testing, only the following line should be enough
to get the system requirements for the default plugins installed::

  sudo apt-get install \
      lzip gir1.2-ostree-1.0 git bzr ostree patch python3-arpy python3-gi


Fedora
++++++
For recent fedora systems, the following line should get you the system
requirements you need::

  dnf install -y \
      python3 fuse bubblewrap \
      python3-pip python3-devel git

For the default plugins::

  dnf install -y \
      bzr git lzip patch ostree python3-gobject
  pip3 install --user arpy


Ubuntu
++++++

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install the dependencies with::

  sudo apt install \
      python3 fuse bubblewrap \
      python3-pip python3-dev git

For the default plugins::

  sudo apt install \
      bzr gir1.2-ostree-1.0 git lzip ostree patch python3-arpy python3-gi

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On Ubuntu 16.04, neither `bubblewrap <https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/>`_
or `ostree <https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree>`_ are available in the official repositories.
You will need to install them in whichever way you see fit. Refer the the upstream documentation
for advice on this.


Installing
~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have the base system dependencies, you can clone the BuildStream
git repository and install it as a regular user::

  git clone https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream.git
  cd buildstream
  pip3 install --user -e .

This will install buildstream's pure python dependencies into
your user's homedir in ``~/.local`` and will run BuildStream directly
from the git checkout directory.

Keep following the instructions below to ensure that the ``bst``
command is in your ``PATH`` and to enable bash completions for it.

.. note::

   We recommend the ``-e`` option because you can upgrade your
   installation by simply updating the checked out git repository.

   If you want a full installation that is not linked to your
   git checkout, just omit the ``-e`` option from the above commands.


Adjust PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~
Since BuildStream is now installed under your local user's install directories,
you need to ensure that ``PATH`` is adjusted.

A regular way to do this is to add the following line to the end of your ``~/.bashrc``::

  export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin"

.. note::

   You will have to restart your terminal in order for these changes to take effect.


Bash completions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bash completions are supported by sourcing the ``buildstream/data/bst``
script found in the BuildStream repository. On many systems this script
can be installed into a completions directory but when installing BuildStream
without a package manager this is not an option.

To enable completions for an installation of BuildStream you
installed yourself from git, just append the script verbatim
to your ``~/.bash_completion``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../buildstream/data/bst
   :language: yaml


Upgrading BuildStream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming you have followed the default instructions above, all
you need to do to upgrade BuildStream is to update your local git
checkout::

  cd /path/to/buildstream
  git pull --rebase

If you did not specify the ``-e`` option at install time or the dependancies
have changed, you will need to cleanly reinstall BuildStream::

  pip3 uninstall buildstream
  cd /path/to/buildstream
  git pull --rebase
  pip3 install --user .


Installing from distro packages
-------------------------------


Arch Linux
~~~~~~~~~~
Packages for Arch exist in `AUR <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages>`_.
Two different package versions are available:

* Latest release: `buildstream <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/buildstream>`_
* Latest development snapshot: `buildstream-git <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/buildstream-git>`_


Fedora
~~~~~~

BuildStream is not yet in the official Fedora repositories, but you can
install it from a Copr::

  sudo dnf copr enable bochecha/buildstream
  sudo dnf install buildstream

Optionally, install the ``buildstream-docs`` package to have the BuildStream
documentation in Devhelp or GNOME Builder.
