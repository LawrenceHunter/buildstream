What you can do with a built project
====

Once you have successfully built a project with Buildstream, 
there are 2 things you can do with it:

- :ref:`invoking_shell` 
- :ref:`invoking_checkout`


Shell
----

This is used to test builds in development, and is run inside of a sandbox environment

Checkout
----

This is used if you want to take the output of the build and move it away from the rest of the files used to generate it
